## Contribute

Help is always welcome! There's two main ways of contributing directly to this project: Translations and code. For translations, you may contribute both fixes to existing texts—including English—as well as entirely new locales. Feel free to work on translations in chunks and to ask for help in getting a new language set up on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/x9hjkKXBew) or forums, especially where localizing the actual map is concerned.

Bug fixes and improvements based on [reported issues](https://github.com/Palanaeum/roshar-map/issues) can be addressed through pull requests if you feel confident to work on the code base. As goes for translations, do not shy away from asking other contributors for pointers on where to start looking.

If you've found a bug or would like to request a feature, please report it on [GitHub's issue tracker](https://github.com/Palanaeum/roshar-map/issues).

For some more detailed instructions on both translating and developing, follow the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

A very special thanks goes out to Reddit user [Stoneward13](https://www.reddit.com/user/Stoneward13) for letting use and modify his awesome high resolution versions of the Roshar and Shadesmar maps.

We also thank the amazing people at [cosmere.es](https://cosmere.es/) and everyone else in our translation Discord server for going through the monumental effort of translating everything to several other languages, and fixing errors in the English text along the way!

Finally, the general appearance and concept of the map derives heavily from the [interactive map](http://witchernetflix.com/) of "The Continent" for Netflix's *The Witcher* series.
