Clicking locations on the map will reveal details about it as well as related events and characters. Browsing the timeline at the bottom of the page allows you to jump between different events on the map and open up more information about those events. If you want to know even more, links to the Coppermind wiki are provided.\n\nThis is a fan-made project that is not affiliated with Dragonsteel Entertainment. All dates and locations are based on a combination of in-world references and our own estimates and assumptions. If you would like to dig further into the timeline of the series, or if you are curious about the references and assumptions used, please visit [Jofwu's Stormlight Archive Timeline project](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zq5bJoKE83ggDCjH43i1hZi0CIpB2iAx7v37zQPVFK0).\n\nMake sure you check out the tutorial if you haven't done so! We hope that you find this to be a fun, insightful, and helpful tool as you read *The Stormlight Archive*!",

    "changelog":  "Welcome to the updated Map & Timeline of Roshar! We've added all events, locations, and characters from both *Dawnshard* and *Rhythm of War*, so if you have not read those titles yet, be careful!\n\n## What's new?\n\nBesides all the current book content, we've been hard at work on new features and general improvements to the map and timeline. Here are the most memorable ones:\n\n * 🔎 **Search:** You can now search events, locations, characters, and more! This feature can be found in the top-right corner next to the settings menu button. \n * 📐 **Measurements:** We consulted the royal cartographer Isasik Shulin and did the math! Accessible from the compass-looking button to the top right of the timeline, you may now measure distances across Roshar and get coordinates for any location on the continent. As a bonus, the graticule we draw on the map should now be more accurate, too!<br>*Note that measurements are based on our own research and might not be entirely accurate.*\n * ⚠️ **Spoiler Filters:** The book filters, under settings, have been reworked to act as spoiler filters! You can now disable events for any books you haven't read, preventing them from appearing on the timeline.<br>*Note that those events will still appear under 'Related Events' on the detailed view of locations or characters, however.*\n * 🤝 **Sharing:** While we don't exactly have Spanreed technology, there now are easily accessible sharing buttons in the details views of everything you can view on the map and timeline! Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and Tumblr are supported by default, but on supported devices such phones, you can use any available sharing option.\n * 📍 **Updated Shadesmar Map:** We found a perpendicularity and had the chance to explore Roshar's Cognitive subastral! The map of Shadesmar has been updated with some of the locations we know so far.\n\nIf you find any issues or errors with any of these changes, feel free to let us know in our [feedback thread](https://www.17thshard.com/forum/topic/92801-interactive-map-and-timeline-of-roshar-feedback/) or with a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Palanaeum/roshar-map/issues)!\n\nHave fun exploring this updated experience!"
