# Sea of Souls

The **Sea of Souls** is a large sea on Roshar's subastral of the Cognitive Realm. It is bordered by the #[Sea of Regret](locations/sea-of-regret), the #[Sea of Lost Lights](locations/sea-of-lost-lights), and the #[Nexus of Imagination](locations/nexus-of-imagination). In the Physical Realm, this sea corresponds to the central part of the continent of Roshar, including the city of #[Urithiru](locations/urithiru), as well as the #[Valley](locations/valley).

The reason this part of Shadesmar is called the Sea of Souls is unclear.
