# Tarat Sea

The **Tarat Sea** is a gulf of the #[Southern Depths](locations/southern-depths) on Roshar.

It is surrounded by the southern coasts of #[Alethkar](locations/alethkar), #[Jah Keved](locations/jah-keved), #[Triax](locations/triax), #[Tu Fallia](locations/tu-fallia), #[Greater Hexi](locations/greater-hexi), the northern coast of #[Frostlands](locations/frostlands), and the city-state of #[Kharbranth](locations/kharbranth) and opens into Longbrow's Straits. There are a number of islands near the coasts of Triax, Tu Fallia and Greater Hexi. Many of the southern rivers in Alethkar and Jah Keved, including the Deathbend River, flow into the Tarat Sea.

The war-room prior to the Battle of Thaylen Field featured a map of the gulf, marking the locations of parts of the Azish and Kharbranth fleets. After the battle, #[Kaladin](characters/kaladin) is sent to find Skar, Drehy and Gavinor Kholin and flies over the gulf from Kharbranth to meet them.
