# Ocean of Origins

The **Ocean of Origins** is a body of water east of Roshar, towards the Origin.

The shores of the Ocean of Origins are sparsely populated, with the cities of #[New Natanan](locations/new-natanan) and Dawn's Shadow being the only notable settlements. This is likely because highstorms make landfall there, and as such hit that coast with the greatest force. To the East, the Ocean of Origins presumably connects to the #[Endless Ocean](locations/endless-ocean) on the opposite side of the planet, while from North and South, it's bracketed by #[Steamwater Ocean](locations/steamwaterocean) and #[Southern Depths](locations/southern-depths).

The Origin of Storms, where the highstorms originate, lies at the far end of the Ocean of Origins. There are multiple legends talking about there being an inhabited island there, populated by people called Uvara in some versions of the story. The version told in New Natanan says that they are sailors who were lost while travelling the Ocean of Origins and that one day, they will come back to reclaim Natanatan.
