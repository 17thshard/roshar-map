# Rira
**Rira** is a kingdom in north-western Roshar, bordering on #[Iri](locations/iri) and #[Babatharnam](locations/babatharnam).

In the Silver Kingdoms era, Rira was a part of #[Iri](locations/iri). Iri continues to be a major influence in Rira in the present day; however, there are some people in Rira who make an effort to keep themselves ideologically and religiously distinct from Iri, as well as the Vorin nations to the east. 

Rira has an Oathgate which #[Jasnah Kholin](characters/jasnah) believes is located in the city of Kurth. Rira is not a current military power and does not possess soulcasters. Rira is also home to the Sunken Forests.
