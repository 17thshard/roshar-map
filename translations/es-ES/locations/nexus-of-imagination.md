# Nexus of Imagination

The **Nexus of Imagination** is a location in Shadesmar. It is bordered by the #[Sea of Souls](locations/sea-of-souls) and the #[Sea of Lost Lights](locations/sea-of-lost-lights). In the Physical Realm, the Nexus of Imagination corresponds to the #[Southern Depths](locations/southern-depths).

Near the start of the True Desolation, Voidspren sailing in warships appeared west of the Nexus of Imagination, near #[Marat](locations/marat) or #[Tukar](locations/tukar) in the Physical Realm. The Voidspren then traveled northeast and captured Cultivation's Perpendicularity.
