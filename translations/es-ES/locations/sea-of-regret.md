# Sea of Regret

The **Sea of Regret** is a large sea on Roshar's subastral of the Cognitive Realm. It is bordered by the #[Nexus of Truth](locations/nexus-of-truth), the #[Nexus of Transition](locations/nexus-of-transition), and the #[Sea of Souls](locations/sea-of-souls). In the Physical Realm, this sea corresponds to the western part of the continent of Roshar, including #[Shinovar](locations/shinovar) and #[Iri](locations/iri).

The reason this part of Shadesmar is called the Sea of Regret is unclear.
