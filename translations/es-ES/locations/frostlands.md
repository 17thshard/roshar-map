# Frostlands

The **Frostlands** are the lawless, sparsely populated southeastern lands of Roshar. They are located outside the boundaries of #[Alethkar](locations/alethkar). They receive the strongest highstorms out of all of Roshar, due to the Frostlands being closest to the Origin out of all of the Stormlands, i.e. Eastern Roshar.

Prominent locations in the Frostlands include #[Kharbranth](locations/kharbranth), the #[Unclaimed Hills](locations/unclaimed-hills), the #[Shattered Plains](locations/shattered-plains), Dawn's Shadow, #[New Natanan](locations/new-natanan), and the #[Shallow Crypts](locations/shallow-crypts).
