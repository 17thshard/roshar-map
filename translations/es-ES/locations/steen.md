# Steen

**Steen** is a kingdom at the tip of a peninsula in southwestern Roshar. As such, it only borders #[Liafor](locations/liafor).

During the Silver Kingdoms era, it was part of Makabakam. Noura describes them as a tricky bunch, and hints that they shouldn't be invited to the #[Urithiru](locations/urithiru) talks along with the other Makabak representatives.

Beard tells a tale about him swimming across a vat of dyes when in service to the Steen merchant lords. The crew of _First Dreams_ on its trip to Akinah is made up of Steen mercenaries.
