# Sesemalex Dar

**Sesemalex Dar** is the capital of the kingdom of #[Emul](locations/emul) on Roshar during the Era of Solitude.

It is one of the most ancient cities in the world. It is said that the city—and the entire kingdom of Emul—was named by Jezrien himself. Some people such as Au-nak believe Sesemalex Dar is a Dawncity. The Emuli believe that Sesemalex Dar is their ancestral homeland and often proclaim of its religious significance.

The city of Sesemalex Dar sits on a stone plain on west coast of Emul. The design of Sesemalex Dar is intricate and often said to be spectacular, built in enormous gashes in the ground to protect it from highstorms. Each trough has a lip of rock diverting water from flowing into the city and a complex drainage system of cracks to help it weather highstorms, as well stone of a unique composition that also helps with the drainage. The pattern of the Sesemalex Dar is central to the Emuli religion. The structure of the city is very similar to #[Yeddaw](locations/yeddaw) and many consider visiting Yeddaw to be the closest thing to seeing Sesemalex Dar itself.
