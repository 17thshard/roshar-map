# The Purelake
> The Purelake seemed to extend forever, wide as an ocean... Rock outcrops broke the lake near the coast, but inward the Purelake grew placid, more empty.

The **Purelake** is a shallow inland lake located in north central Roshar. The people of the region are known as **Purelakers** and are ethnically Selay.

The Purelake is influenced, in some way, by #[Cultivation](characters/cultivation). It is unknown if she has a secondary perpendicularity in the Purelake.
