# Hearthstone
**Hearthstone** is a large but remote town near the eastern boarder of the Sadeas princedom in #[Alethkar](locations/alethkar). The town serves as a focal point for the various farming communities in the region. The northern section of Sadeas princedom, including Hearthstone, is overseen by Highmarshal Meridas Amaram prior to his departure to the #[Shattered Plains](locations/shattered-plains).

It is the home of #[Kaladin's](characters/kaladin) family.
