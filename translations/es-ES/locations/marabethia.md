# Marabethia
> The Marabethians have a saying for those who refuse to see the truth of a situation. 'You have eyes of red and blue', they say. Red for blood dripping. Blue for the water. It is said that these two things are all the \[criminals\] see. Usually they are attacked within one day. And yet, most still wish to take that chance. They prefer the false hope

**Marabethia** is a nation on Roshar occupying the isthmus separating the #[Purelake](locations/purelake) from the #[Reshi Sea](locations/reshi-sea). It is in the north, in Selay lands beside the sea.

The Marabethian people are known to have a great fondness for debate; the city has many pedestals at intersections where men can stand and proclaim his arguments. The residents are known to carry around overripe fruit for discouraging those they disagree with.
