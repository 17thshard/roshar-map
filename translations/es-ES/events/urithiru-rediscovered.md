# Urithiru rediscovered
The Alethi armies escaped to Urithiru via Oathgate to flee from the Everstorm.

## Details
Jasnah Kholin began an effort to rediscover the city after growing convinced that a new Desolation was coming. While she herself was unable to do so, her student, Shallan Davar, managed to complete her works and pinpoint the location of Stormseat, an ancient city that possessed an Oathgate, but was destroyed long before Urithiru was abandoned. She eventually lead the Alethi army to Stormseat--now a listener city called Narak--and, as the listeners summoned the Everstorm, transported them through its Oathgate, rediscovering Urithiru. Following the arrival of the Everstorm, Urithiru became the centre of Alethi military power, with most highprinces, chief among them House Kholin, relocating there along with their armies.
