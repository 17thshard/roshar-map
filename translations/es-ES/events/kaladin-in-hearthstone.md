# Kaladin in Hearthstone
Kaladin arrived in Hearthstone and met with his family, including baby Oroden, before continuing on in search of the missing, transformed singers.

## Details
After the summoning of the Everstorm, Kaladin returned to Hearthstone to aid his family as soon as he was able. He ran out of Stormlight before reaching the town, causing him to walk the final miles and arrive after the Everstorm. Fearing the worst, Kaladin found most of the town's inhabitants to be safe, including his own parents and new younger brother, Oroden. Learning that the city's parshmen had fled after the storm passed, Kaladin set out in search of them.
