# Unification of Alethkar
Gavilar's final opponents are eliminated, Dalinar & Evi were married, and Gavilar was crowned king of Alethkar.

## Details
Dalinar led the attack against Highprince Kalanor, the final holdout against Gavilar's rule, intent on winning the Shards that Kalanor held. While in the battle, Dalinar got so caught up in the Thrill that he didn't realize he killed Kholin men during the assault. Dalinar killed Kalanor in single combat, winning his Shards, but the Thrill was so strong in him that when Gavilar approached him afterwards, Dalinar went after his own brother with the intent to kill him. Only when Gavilar took off his helm and smiled at him did Dalinar snap out of it. Deeply ashamed of himself, Dalinar gifted Gavilar the Shards he had just won, swearing to himself that he must never be king. This battle marked the end of Gavilar's unification war, with Gavilar crowned in the months that followed.
