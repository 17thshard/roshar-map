# Roshar's Creation
At some point in the distant past, Roshar was created or modified by Adonalsium.

## Details
The exact date of Roshar's creation is unclear. It is also unknown whether Roshar was created from nothing or whether the planet (and some lifeforms) were pre-existing in some way. In any case, Adonalsium was directly and intentionally involved with the development of the planet and the lifeforms making their home there.
