# Venli is claimed by Odium
Venli's friends were taken by Fused during an Everstorm. After refusing for herself, Venli was claimed by Odium.

## Details
When nine listeners were chosen by Ulim to receive "new forms," Venli and Demid were among them. In the Everstorm, the Fused replaced their souls and possessed their bodies, with the sole exception of Venli. Odium himself protected her, and she was given envoyform instead. After realizing that the others were effectively dead, Venli once more spotted a strange spren, Timbre, whom she hid from the Fused. Afterwards, Venli became Odium's chief propagandist.
