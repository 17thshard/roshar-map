# Szeth's killing spree begins
Szeth's oathstone was claimed by Taravangian, and the Assassin in White is commanded to assassinate several world leaders.

## Details
With Szeth under his control, Makkek set out to gain wealth, first by killing his fellow robbers and then by establishing a gambling den in Bornwater. On one of Makkek's missions, this time to eliminate a rival who had opened his own gambling place, Szeth infiltrated the local lord's mansion where his target, Gavashaw, resided. After entering Gavashaw's rooms, he met a mysterious stranger who knew of Szeth and his role in Gavilar's death, as well as his powers. After a short confrontation, the man revealed that both Makek and Gavashaw had been killed, and that Szeth's Oathstone was now in the hands of a new master. Thus, Szeth began to unwittingly serve the Diagram. Szeth's new masters gave him a list of high-ranking targets, all of whom were to be eliminated with the same skill displayed over five years prior in Kholinar. Szeth set out to do just that, carving a bloody path across the continent, slaying, among others, two Azish Primes. His second-to-last kill was King Hanavanar of Jah Keved, whom he killed along with his two Shardbearer guards and many others who were present. This led directly into the Veden civil war.
