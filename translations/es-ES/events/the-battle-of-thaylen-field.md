# The Battle of Thaylen Field
The Eila Stele was revealed as the coalition met in Thaylen City. The Everstorm arrived early, bringing Odium and his forces. A battle was fought and Odium is repelled when Dalinar summoned Honor's perpendicularity.

## Details
Following the revelations of the Eila Stele, Thaylenah was one of the few countries to remain with Urithiru, mostly because they had no other choice in their weakened state. It was then that the Voidbringer armies, led by Odium himself, arrived on the shores of Thaylen City, having sailed there from the nearby country of Marat. Though the defenders attempted to prepare for battle, things changed dramatically when Odium first summoned a pair of thunderclasts, and then released Nergaoul upon the Amaram troops, turning them against the people they were supposed to protect. One of the thunderclasts breached the wall and made for the Thaylen Gemstone Reserve, intending to secure the King's Drop, a perfect gemstone that could trap Nergaoul. At the same time, Dalinar went down into the Thaylen Field to face Odium directly. In the ensuing confrontation, Dalinar managed to open Honor's Perpendicularity, providing the Knights Radiant present with much-needed Stormlight.

What resulted was a pitched battle between the defending forces -- mostly the Knights Radiant and Thaylen troops, later reinforced by House Kholin soldiers brought by General Khal through the Oathgate -- and Odium's soldiers, consisting of the two thunderclasts, the Amaram army and the Fused. Much of the city was ruined in the process, although the wall was patched by Jasnah Kholin soulcasting the air in the breach into metal. Ultimately, Nergaoul was trapped in the King's Drop and the remaining Voidbringer forces withdrew.
