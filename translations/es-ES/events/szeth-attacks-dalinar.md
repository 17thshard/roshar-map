# Szeth ataca a Dalinar
Szeth llega a las Llanuras Quebradas para asesinar a Dalinar, quien repele el ataque con ayuda de Kaladin.

## Details
During a highstorm, Szeth attacked King Elhokar's palace on the Shattered Plains, entering it through a hole cut in the wall with his Blade. On his way, he killed Beld and cut through Hobber's midriff, crippling the use of his legs, then proceeded to fight against Adolin, Kaladin, and Dalinar, who all believed he was there to assassinate Elhokar. He quickly gained the upper hand, Lashing Adolin to the ceiling and cutting through Kaladin's arm. However, he ultimately failed, as Kaladin managed to push him through his entryway. The two of them fell to the ground, both surviving. Szeth panicked when he saw Kaladin healing his arm, and when Kaladin told him he was a Windrunner, Szeth fled.
