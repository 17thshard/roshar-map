# The Recreance
After the False Desolation, most orders of the Knights Radiant disbanded, leaving behind their Shardblades and Shardplate.

## Details
The Day of Recreance was the final act of the Knights Radiant. Nine of the ten orders abandoned their Shardblades and Shardplate and broke their oaths, killing their spren. The Order of Skybreakers was the one order that did not participate and instead hid themselves away. For around two thousand years the reason for the Recreance remained unknown until it was rediscovered in the Eila Stele during the True Desolation.
