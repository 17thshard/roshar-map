# Kaladin strung up
After uniting Bridge Four and attempting to protect the crew with their "side carry" maneuver, Kaladin was strung up in a highstorm.

## Details
With no means of protecting his newly united Bridge Four, Kaladin had the crew develop an alternate means of holding the bridge which would offer some protection against Parshendi arrows. The plan worked perfectly when implemented in battle, but several other crews tried to imitate their maneuver and, without practice, failed disastrously. The assult was a total loss, and much of the blame was placed on Kaladin. Sadeas ordered the bridge crew leader strung up outside during a coming highstorm to face the Stormfather's judgement. With the help of a sphere of Stormlight given him by Teft, Kaladin was able to survive the storm.
