# Aimian Sea

The **Aimian Sea** is a body of water that separates the islands of #[Aimia](locations/aimia) from the coast of #[Shinovar](locations/shinovar) on the continent of Roshar. It is a large, deep channel that is connected to the #[Endless Ocean](locations/endless-ocean).

Kaza and the crew of the _First Dreams_ crossed the Aimian Sea from #[Liafor](locations/liafor) in hopes of reaching Akinah and discovering a wealth of gemhearts.
