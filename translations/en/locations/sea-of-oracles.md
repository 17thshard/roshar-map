# Sea of Oracles
The **Sea of Oracles** is a region of the #[Sea of Lost Lights](locations/sea-of-lost-lights). It is north of #[Celebrant](locations/celebrant), Emberdark, and the Burning Gardens. To the south, it is bordered with the #[Glasswater Deep](locations/glasswater-deep). The #[Salavashi Trench](locations/salavashi-trench) is a portion of the Sea of Oracles. In the Physical Realm, the Sea of Oracles corresponds to at least parts of #[Alethkar](locations/alethkar) north of the Deathbend River. It is also north of the #[Tarat Sea](locations/tarat-sea), so it seems the Sea of Oracles goes into #[Jah Keved](locations/jah-keved). The sea's western boundary is unclear.
