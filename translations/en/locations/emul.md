# Emul
**Emul** is a Makabaki kingdom located in southwestern Roshar during the Era of Solitude. The citizens of Emul are referred to as Emuli. Traditionally a rather independent kingdom, the Desolation and war with #[Tukar](locations/tukar) has greatly weakened Emul and left it dependent on others for aid.
