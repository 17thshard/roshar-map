# Azimir Oathgate
The **Azimir Oathgate** in Shadesmar marks the Cognitive Realm reflection of the Oathgate located in #[Azimir](locations/azimir). It is located in the #[Sea of Souls](locations/sea-of-souls). The nearest land is some distance away, near Ageless Beauty.

The Oathgate is represented by a flat platform of a material akin to white marble, the size of the control building. The platform itself is watched over by a pair of enormous spren, both the size of buildings, each wearing a set of armor and holding a spear. One of the spren is white, while the other is shimmering black.
