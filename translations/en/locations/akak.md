# Akak

**Akak** is one of the #[Reshi Isles](locations/reshi-isles), located just to the north of #[Alethkar](locations/alethkar).

#[Dalinar](characters/dalinar), as general, fought and destroyed the Akak Reshi, some time around the year 1155, and claimed the island for Alethkar.

The zatalef is a cephalopod that lives at least in Akak, perhaps in other Reshi Isles.
