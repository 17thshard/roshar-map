# Alethkar
> We've got a noble heritage, Kal, darkeyes and lighteyes alike. Thatâ€™s why the best warriors have always been from Alethkar.

**Alethkar** is the largest and most prominent of the five Vorin nations on Roshar. People from Alethkar are known as **Alethi**, and their royal colors are blue and gold. Prior to the True Desolation, they were engaged in the War of Reckoning against the listeners. At the present, the vast majority of their territory is under control of the Voidbringers.
