# Riino's lighthouse
**Riino's lighthouse** is a lighthouse owned by Riino, found at the end of a peninsula within the #[Sea of Lost Lights](locations/sea-of-lost-lights). The lighthouse functions as a waypoint in which passing ships can restock their supplies, as well as signaling that there is land nearby. The dwelling is also used by Riino to conduct readings of the future for passing travelers. 

The building is a large stone tower that is topped by an enormous bonfire. The bonfire does not give off any heat and, unlike the Shadesmar sun, casts shadows away from itself instead of towards itself. The lighthouse is not overly furnished and contains only a few bits of furniture. Riino has, however, decorated some of the wall space with paintings. A second room, built against the base of the lighthouse and accessible from inside the main building, is where Riino performs his readings. It has large windows and in the middle there is a table on which sits a large crystalline globe that is filled with a bright unknown substance. This room is also decorated with paintings, including one of the city of Elantris. A second painting depicts people kneeling before a bright white mirror, that may represent a perpendicularity.
