# Kholinar Oathgate
The **Kholinar Oathgate** in Shadesmar marks the Cognitive Realm reflection of the Oathgate located in #[Kholinar](locations/kholinar). The Kholinar Oathgate is located barely in sight of land--the peninsula from a tributary of the Windrunner River. 

The Oathgate is represented by a flat platform of a material akin to white marble, the size of the control building. The platform itself is watched over by a pair of enormous spren, both the size of buildings, each wearing a set of armor and holding a spear. One of the spren is white, while the other is shimmering black.
