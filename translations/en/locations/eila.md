# Eila

**Eila** is a city in #[Iri](locations/iri) in northwestern Roshar during the Era of Solitude. It is located in southern Iri at the foot of the #[Misted Mountains](locations/misted-mountains), near Iri's borders with #[Shinovar](locations/shinovar) and #[Babatharnam](locations/babatharnam).

The Eila Stele, an ancient carving written in Dawnchant, presumably originated in or was discovered in the city.
