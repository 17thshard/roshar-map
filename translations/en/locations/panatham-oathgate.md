# Panatham Oathgate
The **Panatham Oathgate** in Shadesmar marks the Cognitive Realm reflection of the Oathgate located in #[Panatham](locations/panatham). It is located in the #[Sea of Regret](locations/sea-of-regret). The nearest land is the western end of the island corresponding to the #[Purelake](locations/purelake) in the Physical Realm.

The Oathgate is represented by a flat platform of a material akin to white marble, the size of the control building. The platform itself is watched over by a pair of enormous spren, both the size of buildings, each wearing a set of armor and holding a spear. One of the spren is white, while the other is shimmering black.
