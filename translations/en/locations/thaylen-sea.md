# Thaylen Sea
The **Thaylen Sea** is a location south of the #[Sea of Lost Lights](locations/sea-of-lost-lights) in Shadesmar, the subastral of Roshar. In the Physical Realm, the sea corresponds to the island of #[Thaylenah](locations/thaylenah). The Thaylen Sea is north of the Nexus of Imagination. It is very close to the #[Glasswater Deep](locations/glasswater-deep) and #[Luminous Shallows](locations/luminous-shallows) of the Sea of Lost Lights, although no direct waterways are visible in the available maps. Nazh marked the location of #[Thaylen City Oathgate](locations/thaylen-city-oathgate) on the edge of the sea; northwest of the Oathgate there is a lake which Nazh hates. The lake corresponds to an island in #[Longbrow's Straits](locations/longbrows-straits) in the Physical Realm.
