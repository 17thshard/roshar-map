# Kharbranth
> Kharbranth is one of the most sheltered major cities in the world, and the bells are a symbol of that. It’s said they were first erected to warn that a highstorm was blowing, since the winds were so soft that people didn’t always notice.

Kharbranth, City of Bells, is an independent city-state on Roshar, ruled by King #[Taravangian](characters/taravangian). It is one of the five Vorin nations and home to the Palanaeum, the largest library on Roshar. Kharbranth is known for the quality of its hospitals, and people come from all over the world to study medicine from Kharbranth's surgeons. The Kharbranthian royal colors are burnt orange and white, and have become synonymous around Roshar as the colors of surgeons, medicine, and healing.
