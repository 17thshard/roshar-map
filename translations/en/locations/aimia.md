# Aimia
**Aimia** is a group of islands on Roshar that is separated from the main continent by the #[Aimian Sea](locations/aimian-sea). The islands contained one of the Silver Kingdoms of Roshar that survived the Desolations. As far as can be gleaned, the Kingdom of Aimia existed for most of the Era of Solitude, but at some point it was decimated in the Scouring of Aimia.
