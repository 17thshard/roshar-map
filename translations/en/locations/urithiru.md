# Urithiru
> Urithiru was said to be the center of the Silver Kingdoms, a city that held ten thrones, one for each king. It was the most majestic, most amazing, most important city in all the world.

**Urithiru** is a tower-city on Roshar that functioned as the home of the Knights Radiant and the central point of the Silver Kingdoms during the Heraldic Epochs. In the present day, it serves as the headquarters of the forces opposing #[Odium](characters/odium), including the refounded Knights Radiant, as well as the remaining Alethi soldiers and nobility. The current Queen of Alethkar rules from Urithiru.
