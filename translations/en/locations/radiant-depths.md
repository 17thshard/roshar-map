# The Radiant Depths
The **Radiant Depths** is a trench in the #[Sea of Souls](locations/sea-of-souls), part of the Rosharan subastral of the Cognitive Realm. It is south of #[Nohadon's Stairways](locations/nohadons-stairways), and is likely named after the Knights Radiant. It is east of a peninsula where the lighthouse Abiding Light is located, and north of #[Nameless](locations/nameless). In their expedition to Lasting Integrity, #[Shallan](characters/shallan) and #[Adolin](characters/adolin) travel through the Radiant Depths to reach Nameless. The Radiant Depths correspond at least to #[Marat](locations/marat) in the Physical Realm, and possibly other nations to the east.
