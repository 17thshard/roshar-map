# Dumadari

**Dumadari** is a city on Roshar at the border of #[Jah Keved](locations/jah-keved) and #[Alethkar](locations/alethkar).

In 1168, shortly after the death of #[Gavilar Kholin](characters/gavilar), Dalinar plans to take an army via Dumadari and sail to #[New Natanan](locations/new-natanan) to set up a base on the #[Shattered Plains](locations/shattered-plains) before the rest of the Alethi armies arrive. He uses the journey as a cover for visiting the Nightwatcher.

In 1173, Princess #[Jasnah Kholin](characters/jasnah) visited Dumadari, likely while doing research of some sort. When Brightness Shallan Davar wrote to Jasnah requesting to become her ward, Jasnah invited her to come to Dumadari in two weeks for consideration. Jasnah did not believe that Shallan would arrive in Dumadari before she herself had left, but she did not know where she would be traveling next. Shallan was shocked that Jasnah had responded, but she arrived in Dumadari after Jasnah's departure. However, Jasnah had left a note in Dumadari requesting that Shallan follow Jasnah to her next destination.
