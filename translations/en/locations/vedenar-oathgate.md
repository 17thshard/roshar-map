# Vedenar Oathgate
The **Vedenar Oathgate** in Shadesmar marks the Cognitive Realm reflection of the Oathgate located in #[Vedenar](locations/vedenar). It is located in the #[Sea of Lost Lights](locations/sea-of-lost-lights) and the #[Sea of Oracles](locations/sea-of-oracles). It is near the coast and not far from the Burning Gardens.

The Oathgate is represented by a flat platform of a material akin to white marble, the size of the control building. The platform itself is watched over by a pair of enormous spren, both the size of buildings, each wearing a set of armor and holding a spear. One of the spren is white, while the other is shimmering black.
