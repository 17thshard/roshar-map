# Kurth Oathgate
The **Kurth Oathgate** in Shadesmar marks the Cognitive Realm reflection of the Oathgate located in #[Kurth](locations/kurth). It is located adjacent to shore in a lake corresponding to the island that Kurth is situated on in the #[Reshi Sea](locations/reshi-sea). It is just south of the #[Nexus of Transition](locations/nexus-of-transition).

The Oathgate is represented by a flat platform of a material akin to white marble, the size of the control building. The platform itself is watched over by a pair of enormous spren, both the size of buildings, each wearing a set of armor and holding a spear. One of the spren is white, while the other is shimmering black.
