Venli is reunited with her mother and the rest of the listeners who survived among the Shattered Plains.

## Details
#[Venli](characters/venli) and her group from #[Urithiru](locations/urithiru) find the listeners on the #[Shattered Plains](locations/shattered-plains). Venli approaches alone; when Thude recognizes her, he at first runs away before he sees Venli draw in Stormlight. The other listeners all look at her with suspicion and hostility, but they allow her into the camp to see her mother. She brings a Reacher with her in the hope that the spren and her mother can bond so Jaxlim's mind can begin to heal, promising Thude that there are hundreds more willing to bond singers. Kneeling before her mother, Venli sings the first song Jaxlim had ever taught her; afterwards, she reasons with Thude about their mutual need for allies. A chasmfiend shows itself, and Venli realizes that that was how the group escaped the chasms the night of the everstorm. Jaxlim suddenly recognizes Venli, and Venli hears a female voice in her mind finally accepting her second Ideal.
