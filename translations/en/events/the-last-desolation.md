# The Last Desolation
Nine Heralds abandoned the Oathpact. The cycle of Desolations seems to end and the Era of Solitude began.

## Details
At the end of what is called the Last Desolation, nine of ten Heralds managed to survive the fighting, which was an unusual occurrence. Fearful of the torture they would face on their return to Braize, the Heralds chose to break the Oathpact rather than return. Although they had been warned that lingering on Roshar would lead to another Desolation, Ishar told the others that Taln alone would be enough to maintain the Oathpact. Whether or not this was true mattered little to the Heralds as they only wished to avoid torture. The Heralds left their Honorblades in a circle and all walked in a different direction, telling people that humanity had finally won the war for good. Ishar's prediction turned out to be true, and Taln held back the Fused for 4500 years while mankind believed there would be no more Desolations.
