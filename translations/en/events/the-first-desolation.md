# The First Desolation
War broke out between the humans, backed by Honor and Cultivation, and the native singers, backed by Odium. The cycle of Desolations began and the Oathpact was formed.

## Details
The first Desolation occurred when mankind invaded Roshar. They had destroyed their previous home with Surgebinding and came to Roshar seeking shelter. The singers granted them the land that would later become Shinovar. Dissatisfied with what they had been given, the humans decided to invade the rest of the continent. This was the first military conflict between humans and singers. A singer who witnessed the invasion wrote the Eila Stele as a warning against trusting humans.
