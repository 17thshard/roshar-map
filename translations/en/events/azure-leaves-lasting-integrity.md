# Azure departs Lasting Integrity
Azure departs from the Honorspren stronghold of Lasting Integrity.

## Details
After her travels with Kaladin, Shallan, and Adolin through Shadesmar, Azure continued with Notum and the Honorspren to Lasting Integrity. She remained there for roughly half a year before departing for reasons apparently unknown to the Honorspren. She was the last human to leave the city before the arrival of Shallan and Adolin in 1175.
