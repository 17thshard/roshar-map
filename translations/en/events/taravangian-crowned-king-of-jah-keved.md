## Details
The Diagram showed that to save human kind, Taravangian needed to unite Roshar under his rule. Using Szeth to assassinate Jah Keved's king, Hanavanar, Taravangian caused the nation to be plunged into a devastating succession war, which wiped out all of the remaining highprinces. Taravangian arrived at the city in time for the death of the last Veden Highprince, Valam, who named him king of Jah Keved. Taravangian was able to fulfill his plot without anyone suspecting his intervention.
