# Urithiru liberated
Navani bonds with the Sibling and restores the tower as Kaladin speaks his Fourth Ideal and leads the defense of the tower with support from Venli and Rlain.

## Details
#[Kaladin](characters/kaladin) wakes from his nightmares, and the Sibling speaks to him, telling him the enemy has found the final node. Kaladin wakes Teft, informing him of the situation, and they decide to proceed with their plans to evacuate as many Radiants from the tower as possible. As they approach the atrium, the Pursuer engages Kaladin in battle. During their fight, Moash kills Phendorana with anti-Stormlight and kills Teft, dropping the body in front of Kaladin. With Kaladin in a daze, the Pursuer attacks again, prompting Kaladin to fight back with unprecedented rate. After killing the Pursuer, Kaladin chases a Heavenly One who races to the top of the tower with Lirin before throwing the man from the top of the tower. Kaladin leaps after him.

#[Venli](characters/venli), having returned to the tower after deciding to help Kaladin's familiy escape, watches the fight between Kaladin and the Pursuer. As the Pursuer's soldiers begin to attack the unconscious Radiants, the humans defending them, Venli confesses to Leshwi that she is a Knight Radiant, and Leshwi orders her Fused to join in the cause of the humans.

#[Navani](characters/navani) hears a commotion when the final node is destroyed, leaving the crystal pillar clear to approach. She takes a dagger charged with anti-Voidlight and sneaks towards Raboniel, activating a painrial hidden among the boxes in the corridor on her way. Raboniel tells Navani she should flee, but promptly walks into the painrial trap. She stabs Raboniel, but when the painrial runs out she realizes the Fused is still alive. While speaking with the dying Raboniel, Moash returns from killing Teft, marching toward Navani. Navani stumbles toward the crystal pillar and speaks to the Sibling, ultimately convincing them to bond her instead of Rlain just as Moash reaches her.

#[Dalinar](characters/dalinar) is able to Connect Kaladin to a vision of Tien, which inspires Kaladin to speak his Fourth Ideal. With newly formed Shardplate, Kaladin saves Lirin and returns to the battle inside the atrium. Navani and the Sibling work to flush Urithiru of Voidlight, reactivating the towers' defenses, rendering the Fused powerless and liberating the tower.
