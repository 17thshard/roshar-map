# Wit meets with Odium
Odium and Wit meet face to face, and Odium destroys some of Wit's memories without him realizing.

## Details
#[Wit](characters/wit) has left the others and is now at the Pinnacle. He does tricks for an "audience," a group of spren corrupted by Sja-anat, and explains the importance of subtlety in magic tricks and storytelling. Design contemplates that Wit's tricks with a coin don't work that well on Roshar because coins aren't used to trade there. Wit eventually tells Design to go bother someone else and moves to Elhokar's sitting room.

Soon after, #[Odium](characters/odium) arrives, shows his rage at Wit's contract, and threatens him. However, Odium also asks Wit what his choice of champion would be, which surprises Wit. As the latter leaves the room and walks in the hallways, he ponders whether or not Rayse is growing more thoughtful. Realizing that Wit might have doubts about his identity, Odium attacks Wit. Odium's voice is thoughtful and soft, and Wit feels true horror as he realizes his enemy isn't Rayse any longer. Odium then destroys some of Wit's memories, held in his Breaths. 

Wit regains consciousness in the hallway, unaware of what happened, and returns to Elhokar's sitting room where the scene happens once again, Odium playing the angry brute more convincingly this time. Wit leaves after saying a different quip than the previous time but has trouble whistling, the loss of Breaths preventing him from using perfect pitch. He wonders if something is wrong as the inconsistencies linked to his memory loss piles up. However, he considers that this encounter went exactly as planned.
