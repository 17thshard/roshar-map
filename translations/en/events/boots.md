# Boots!
Shallan and Kaladin met for the first time, with Shallan pretending to be a Horneater princess.

## Details
Unsure of the loyalties of an approaching group of soldiers, and at the prompting of Tyn, Shallan impersonated Horneater royalty at her first meeting with Kaladin on the outskirts of the Shattered Plains. She demanded, and received, his boots in payment for a feigned slight.
