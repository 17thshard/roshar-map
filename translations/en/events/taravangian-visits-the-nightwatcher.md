## Details
Following revelations from Gavilar, Taravangian visited the Nightwatcher and asked for "capacity to save humankind" from the coming Desolation. He was granted great intelligence and great compassion, but the apparent curse of not having them at the same time. As a result, he wakes up every morning with a fluctuation of both. Despite his apparent belief that this boon and curse were granted by the Nightwatcher, Cultivation was actually the one responsible.
