# Second node destroyed
The Sibling calls for Kaladin to aid them by destroying the second of their four nodes.

## Details
#[Kaladin](characters/kaladin) leaves Dabbid to watch Teft while he goes to learn what he can about the Oathgates and how they are still working. He uses Adhesion to climb up and down the side of the tower but is too slow to be able to see the Oathgates in operation. Syl warns Kaladin of some scouts, and they realize that the scouts must be communicating with those operating the Oathgates using spanreeds. Kaladin resolves to steal the spanreed, so he sends Syl to follow them. He trails them to a spanreed hub and finds a ventilation shaft that he can use to get above the room while avoiding detection. He does, and then uses Adhesion to pull up a group of spanreeds. Kaladin returns to the hall and finds the Sibling blinking a light at him. They tell him that the occupying force has found another node and that they need him to save them.

Kaladin follows the Sibling's light, fighting off guards as he encounters them, having to use different maneuvers than those to which he is accustomed. The Sibling leads him through a hidden passageway between two shops, and he runs into a woodworker. He comes out eventually at an open air tunnel to see Raboniel infusing the node and the Pursuer standing by. The Pursuer and Kaladin fight, and Syl stops the Pursuer from killing him by pretending to be a Voidspren. Eventually, the Pursuer has to take a brief break, and Kaladin has a short exchange with Raboniel. When the Pursuer returns, Kaladin tricks him into giving chase and enlists the Sibling's help to lock him in a room. Kaladin then returns to the node and destroys it with a rock. Suddenly exhausted, he is taken by surprise and Raboniel stabs him in the chest. As Kaladin realizes that he is unable to heal quickly, Raboniel manipulates him into not killing her and tells him to flee.
