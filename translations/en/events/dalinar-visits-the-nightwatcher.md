# Dalinar visits the Nightwatcher
Dalinar visited Nightwatcher. Cultivation granted his request instead, removing all memories of Evi.

## Details
Following the assassination of Gavilar, Dalinar was determined to seek vengeance on his brother's behalf. Suffering from alcoholism and tormented by the murder of his own wife, Evi, Dalinar decided to quietly visit the Nightwatcher before travelling to the Shattered Plains. In the Valley, he found Cultivation herself with the Nightwatcher. Cultivation granted Dalinar's request, in a way, causing all memories of his wife to be removed... until they were gradually restored several years later.
