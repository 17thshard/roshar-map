# Battle of the Tower
Kaladin saved Dalinar and Adolin's forces after betrayal at the hands of Sadeas.

## Details
Dalinar and Sadeas arranged a joint plateau run to the infamous plateau known as 'the Tower', where no Alethi army had yet proven victorious. As Dalinar's forces became engaged, Sadeas betrayed Dalinar, withdrawing his troops and leaving Dalinar surrounded. Kaladin and Bridge Four returned to the plateau, giving Dalinar, Adolin, and a remnant of their forces an opportunity to escape.
