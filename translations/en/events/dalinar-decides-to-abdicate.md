# Dalinar decides to abdicate
Unable to make the highprinces coooperate and concerned for his own sanity, Dalinar decided to abdicate in favor of Adolin.

## Details
With every highprince (aside from rivaling Sadeas) rejecting Dalinar's proposal of joint plateau assults to end the war on the Shattered Plains sooner, Dalinar found himself at a loss for how to unite the Alethi as his visions seemed to demand. Furthermore, between Adolin's strong objections to Dalinar's obsession with the visiions and the sudden spells of revulsion accompanying Dalinar's experiences with the Thrill, Dalinar began to question his own sanity and ability to lead. He began making plans to abdicate his position in favor of Adolin.
