Attacked by Ghostbloods aboard *Wind's Pleasure*, Jasnah accidentally transported herseful fully into Shadesmar and found immediate return to the Physical Realm impossible. Months later, Jasnah was able to transition back somewhere in the Unclaimed Hills, where she was greeted by Wit. Jasnah carefully returned to the Shattered Plains only to find the Warcamps abandoned and the tower city of Urithiru rediscovered.
