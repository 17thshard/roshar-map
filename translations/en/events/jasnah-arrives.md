# Jasnah arrives in Urithiru
Believed dead after the shipwreck off the coasts of the Frostlands, Jasnah shocked everyone with her sudden arrival in Urithiru.

## Details
After returning to the Physical Realm, Jasnah travelled for a time with Wit before arriving alone at the Shattered Plains. With no means to contact her family upon her return and assassins presumably still interested in her demise, Jasnah chose to maintain her anonymitiy until her safe arrival in Urithiru.
