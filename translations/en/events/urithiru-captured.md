# Urithiru captured
Following Taravangian's betrayal, Raboniel leads her forces in an assault on Urithiru. Navani is barely able to establish the Sibling's defenses before the tower is fully captured.

## Details
As #[Taravangian](characters/taravangian) betrays the coalition, Raboniel's forces sneak in through the basements of #[Urithiru](locations/urithiru) in a surprise attack on the tower city. After corrupting a portion of the crystal pillar with Voidlight, the tower's defenses are inverted such that most of the Knights Radiant in the tower are immediately rendered unconscious. Various Fused and and their singer armies assault the city, and #[Venli](characters/venli) watches on as Raboniel attempts to fully corrupt the crystal pillar.

#[Navani](characters/navani) is questioning Dabbid when the tower's defenses are disabled. They quickly determine that the city is under attack and send runners to organize the available military leaders as Dabbid helps Navani make contact with the Sibling. Meanwhile, #[Kaladin](characters/kaladin) carries an unconscious Teft to his family's quarters, and decides to lay low after realizing that the tower is defenseless. Working deep into the night, Navani organizes a desperate resistance. The Sibling informs her that they will soon fall to Raboniel's corruption unless Navani is able to activate a backup defense system to protect the crystal pillar. While Teofil leads a suicide mission to attack at the heart of the tower, Navani locates one of the tower's defense nodes and fills it with Stormlight to activate the fabrial. Finally, she destroys the node itself.

Navani is captured and brought to Raboniel, making her way through the corpses of the soldiers who had fought and died to give them the time they needed to protect the tower. Navani agrees to surrender under the condition that the people in the tower will be allowed to continue living and working, but the unconscious Radiants are to be delivered to the Fused. Raboniel asks Navani about her sketches and praises her remarkable engineering ability. Raboniel offers to hire her to work on fabrial projects, and Navani considers this, as this would both give her the ability to keep an eye on what she is doing and give her the opportunity to uncover some of Raboniel's ancient secrets. 

As Raboniel's forces search the city for Radiants, Teft is found and nearly taken before Kaladin decides to fight back. He carries Teft deep into the tower looking for a place to hide.
