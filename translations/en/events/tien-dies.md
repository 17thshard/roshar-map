# Tien dies
Tien dies in battle.

## Details
Less than four months after being drafted, Tien was killed during battle against Brightlord Hallaw. During the encounter, he was assigned to Sheler’s company under the squad leader Varth along with two other undertrained messenger boys. Unable to use the boys effectively in combat, Varth positioned the three at the front of the lines, to act as a distraction for the enemy. He saw the three messengers as liabilities due to their lack of training. Tien and the two other messengers were killed by an enemy lighteyes, after Varth pulled his squad pulled back, leaving the three of them exposed to the enemy. Kaladin, who had been looking for his brother during the battle, arrived moments before Tien was struck down and killed. He lay on the battlefield with his brother’s corpse for hours, not returning to camp until long after the battle had ended. Tien’s parents received notice of his death from Kaladin, shortly after the incident.
