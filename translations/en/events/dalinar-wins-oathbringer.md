# Dalinar wins Oathbringer
Dalinar won the Shardblade Oathbringer upon killing its previous owner, Tanalan, at Rathalas.

## Details
During the campaign to unite Alethkar under Gavilar as king, the brothers found themselves attacking the city of Rathalas. With only Shardplate at the time, Dalinar reached and killed the city's ruler, Tanalan senior. The man's young son took up his father's Blade against Dalinar, but was easily swept aside by Dalinar. The Shardblade, Oathbringer, became Dalinar's. Though Dalinar led some to believe he killed the boy, Tanalan junior was allowed to escape.
