# Taravangian Ascends
Taravangian kills Rayse with Nightblood and seizes the Shard for himself.

## Details
#[Taravangian](characters/taravangian) wakes on a stupid day--the dumbest he's ever been. He begins to cry while contemplating it. He leaves his bed only when his hunger gets to be too much, and finds a note and two gemstones containing corrupted spren from #[Renarin](characters/renarin) in his food basket. The note reads, "I'm sorry." Taravangian begins to eat, but hides in the corner as a highstorm approaches. #[Szeth](characters/szeth) breaks into his prison, scaring the guards away. He's there to ask about Taravangian's knowledge of his father and Ishar. As Taravangian pleads, Szeth switches subjects to the murders he committed under Taravangian's orders. Taravangian attempts to run but falls, and Szeth pins him to the wall. #[Odium](characters/odium) approaches. Szeth resolves out loud to kill Taravangian according to his own choice, and pulls out a knife. Odium pulls Taravangian's mind into the Cognitive Realm as Szeth kills Taravangian's body. Seeing Nighblood's manifestation in the Cognitive Realm, Taravangian draws it, kills Rayse with Nightblood, and picks up the power, becoming Odium. 

Taravangian starts adjusting to the power of Odium. He discovers that Rayse had been weakening for a long time, starting with his battles in the past, then being wounded by Honor, and his failures with Dalinar, Kaladin, and Urithiru. In the Physical realm, Szeth finds Rayse's body in the prison, eaten away by Nightblood, and assumes it to be Taravangian. As Taravangian begins to struggle with his conflicting desires to both save the world and destroy it, he becomes aware of #[Cultivation](characters/cultivation) approaching. Taravangian studies future possibilities as he grows more accustomed and capable with the power of Odium. He talks with Cultivation about her gamble in preparing him for this. Having knowledge of the Cosmere at large from Rayse's experiences, Taravangian begins planning to himself to intervene on other worlds, and how to beat #[Dalinar](characters/dalinar). He realizes that there are other possibilities Rayse missed. Cultivation offers to teach him to use their powers. Taravangian accepts and resolves to save them all.
