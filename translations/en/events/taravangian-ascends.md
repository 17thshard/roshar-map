## Details
#[Taravangian](taravangian) wakes on a stupid day--the dumbest he's ever been. He begins to cry while contemplating it. He leaves his bed only when his hunger gets to be too much, and finds a note and two gemstones containing corrupted spren from #[Renarin](renarin) in his food basket. The note reads, "I'm sorry." Taravangian begins to eat, but hides in the corner as a highstorm approaches. #[Szeth](szeth) breaks into his prison, scaring the guards away. He's there to ask about Taravangian's knowledge of his father and Ishar. As Taravangian pleads, Szeth switches subjects to the murders he committed under Taravangian's orders. Taravangian attempts to run but falls, and Szeth pins him to the wall. #[Odium](odium) approaches. Szeth resolves out loud to kill Taravangian according to his own choice, and pulls out a knife. Odium pulls Taravangian's mind into the Cognitive Realm as Szeth kills Taravangian's body. Seeing Nighblood's manifestation in the Cognitive Realm, Taravangian draws it, kills Rayse with Nightblood, and picks up the power, becoming Odium.
