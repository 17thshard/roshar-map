# Renarin discovers the gemstone archive
Renarin discovered the gemstones in Urithiru's library.

## Details
Noting something strange about one wall of the library in Urithiru's basement, Renarin discovered that gems were contained within compartments in the wall. Further inspection revealed that filling the gemstones with Stormlight caused strange vibration patterns, which were decrpted into messages from Radiants around the time of the Recreance.
