# Ashyn Exodus
Fleeing the destruction of their homeworld, humans from Ashyn settled in Shinovar.

## Details
> They came from another world, using powers that we have been forbidden to touch. Dangerous powers, of spren and Surges. They destroyed their lands and have come to us begging. We took them in, as commanded by the gods. What else could we do? They were a people forlorn, without a home. Our pity destroyed us.
> â€”From the Eila Stele

Fleeing the destruction of their homeworld, humans from Ashyn, travelled by magical means to Roshar. At the prompting of the Shards, Honor and Cultivation, the native singers welcomed the humans, who initially settled in Shinovar.
