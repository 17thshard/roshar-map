# Kaladin becomes a slave
Kaladin killed a Shardbearer on the battlefield. Amaram took the Shards for himself, and branded Kaladin a slave to keep his secret.

## Details
While attempting to kill a brightlord on the battlefield, and thus earn his squad enough honor to be transferred to the Shattered Plains, Kaladin's entire squad was nearly slaughtered by a mysterious Shardbearer. Seeking vengeance, Kaladin attacked the Shardbearer who had set his sights on Amaram. Kaladin was miraculously successful, stabbing the Shardbearer through the slits on his helmet. Kaladin was offered the Shards, but rejected them. Convinced by Restares to take the Shards for himself, Amaram had the rest of Kaladin's squad killed and branded Kaladin as a slave in order to keep the secret of his theft.
