# Founding of the Knights Radiant
During the Heraldic Epochs, humans began developing Nahel bonds with spren. Urithiru is constructed and the Knights Radiant were established.

## Details
Sometime during the Desolations, humans began to develop special bonds with spren, called Nahel bonds, granting them the powers of Surgebinding. The Knights Radiant were eventually founded to give organization and leadership to these Surgebinders. The tower city of Urithiru was erected around the same time, and served as the headquarters of the Knights Radiant.
