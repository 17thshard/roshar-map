# Szeth attacks Dalinar
Szeth arrived at the Shattered Plains to assassinate Dalinar, and was repelled with the help of Kaladin.

## Details
During a highstorm, Szeth attacked King Elhokar's palace on the Shattered Plains, entering it through a hole cut in the wall with his Blade. On his way, he killed Beld and cut through Hobber's midriff, crippling the use of his legs, then proceeded to fight against Adolin, Kaladin, and Dalinar, who all believed he was there to assassinate Elhokar. He quickly gained the upper hand, Lashing Adolin to the ceiling and cutting through Kaladin's arm. However, he ultimately failed, as Kaladin managed to push him through his entryway. The two of them fell to the ground, both surviving. Szeth panicked when he saw Kaladin healing his arm, and when Kaladin told him he was a Windrunner, Szeth fled.
