# Dalinar and Odium set terms
Dalinar and Odium meet and discuss final terms and a date for the contest of champions.

## Details
#[Dalinar](characters/dalinar), #[Szeth](characters/szeth), and the Windrunners return from #[Tukar](tukar) just in time to hear news of #[Urithiru's](locations/urithiru) liberation. After sending a message to #[Navani](characters/navani) and asking to meet with #[Jasnah](characters/jasnah) and the Prime after the impending highstorm, Dalinar goes to his quarters. As he enters, he walks onto a golden field and realizes that #[Odium](characters/odium) has come to speak with him. As Odium tries to provoke Dalinar into revealing the nature of his relationship with Ishar, Dalinar realizes that Odium is frightened of him and attempts to provoke Odium in turn. Odium looks at the terms #[Wit](characters/wit) has written on Dalinar's behalf and angrily detects the worldhopper's hand in them. He tells Dalinar that he is incapable of accepting the terms, now that the Everstorm has changed the situation, then explains that his plan has been to use the Rosharans as hardened warriors to fight for him in the cosmere.

Odium expresses interest in making an agreement that day, so he describes his terms: as Dalinar has to give up the idea of Odium restraining the Fused in the event of Dalinar's victory, Odium would give up his designs for Roshar and leave the Rosharan system in the event of his own victory. Dalinar, forewarned by Wit, refuses to make any agreement that will allow Odium to leave the Rosharan system, so they continue to negotiate until they settle on something acceptable, despite Dalinar's horror at the prospect of his failure, to them both: a battle of champions in ten days. Should Dalinar's champion win, Odium will cease all hostilities, return #[Alethkar](locations/alethkar) and #[Herdaz](locations/herdaz) to the coalition, and remain bound to the system. Should Odium's champion win, he will still cease hostilities and remain bound to the system, but he will keep what land he has conquered and will gain Dalinar's soul as a Fused.
