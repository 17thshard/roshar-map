# The coalition regroups
Dalinar and the coalition consider the state of the world following the Battle of Thaylen Field.

## Details
Shallan, Dalinar, and many of Dalinar's generals as well as a few members of the coalition gather in a room in Urithiru. Shallan uses her Lightweaving to make a map of Roshar at Dalinar's request, changing the colors of various countries to depict which ones are members of the coalition, members of Azir's coalition, lands controlled by Odium, and lands that hadn't committed to either side, such as Shinovar and Tukar. The generals argue over what course of action to pursue, and Shallan raises the question of why the humans don't just retreat to Shinovar, the land they were given, to which Dalinar answers that Odium will overrun them even if they give the Parshendi what they deserve. 

Dalinar and Adolin argue over who should become the next King of Alethkar, with Dalinar not wanting Gavinor, as he's too young. Not wanting to accept the responsibility himself, Adolin reveals his murder of Torol Sadeas to Dalinar and his breaking of the Codes of War. Ultimate, Jasnah is chosen to become queen of Alethkar.
