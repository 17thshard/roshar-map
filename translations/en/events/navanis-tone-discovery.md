# Navani named "Voice of Lights"
Raboniel names Navani "Voice of Lights" and gifts her metal plates used in an ancient style of singer music, which gives Navani the final clue she needs to create anti-Light.

## Details
#[Navani](characters/navani) is fully engrossed in her work, completely oblivious to everything except her lab as she tries to find anti-Light. She uses the sand that Raboniel gave her, which starts black and turns white when exposed to Investiture. Navani and Raboniel discuss where the sand came from and how you have to travel through Shadesmar to get to other worlds. As they work, Raboniel asks why Navani does not believe herself a true scholar, declaring that she believes Navani to be one. Raboniel gives her the title "Voice of Lights," telling her that she is an equal to herself; Navani, on the other hand, is convinced that she has Raboniel fooled. Navani is getting better at interpreting the rhythms, and she can tell that Raboniel has a different purpose in mind behind this project than to kill #[Odium](characters/odium). Navani tries to convince Raboniel to negotiate a treaty with her, but she refuses. 

Raboniel leaves Navani to her work but later returns with metal plates and two singers to help her create the Rhythm of War using an ancient method of music. After Raboniel leaves, Navani tries to speak with the Sibling and finally hears a response. The Sibling says that they are weak and cold and don't want to die, and soon their voice fades away. Navani looks around her lab and realizes that the music left patterns in the sand. She then realizes that Stormlight and Voidlight are not just illumination or a substance that bears properties of fluid. They are sounds and vibrations, and therefore, she is convinced she can find an opposite vibration to produce anti-Light.
