# Kaladin's future unclear
Kaladin discuses his future with Zahel after being "promoted" by Dalinar.

## Details
After returning from the battle in #[Hearthstone](locations/hearthstone), #[Kaladin](characters/kaladin) is summoned by #[Dalinar](characters/dalinar) and informed that he will be removed from the front lines of the war as the effects of his battle shock continue to worsen. Dalinar offers a promotion to Kaladin, so that he can continue serving in the military off the battlefield, but Kaladin is skeptical that this is a viable option.

Two weeks later, Dalinar announces Kaladin's change in status, and Kaladin promotes Sigzil and Skar to take over his previous duties. Immediately after the meeting, he goes to the sparring grounds in search of Zahel. Hearing that he is on laundry duty, Kaladin walks toward an outdoor area where they hang clothes to dry. When Kaladin explains that he has been forced into retirement, the pair discuss a possible future for Kaladin in the ardentia. Telling Kaladin to prove that he belongs there, Zahel initiates a fight. Kaladin summons Syl as a sword, and Zahel strikes back at him with the laundry; as they fight, Zahel gets Kaladin to search out why he really fights. He asks if Kaladin believes in the Almighty, and they discuss the topic until Kaladin finds himself on the ground with his own knife to his head. Zahel tells him to return when he can truly hate the fight. Kaladin asks him if he is like #[Wit](characters/wit), which leads to an explanation of Zahel's understanding of Invested entities before Kaladin finally leaves him.
