# Szeth named Truthless
Szeth was named Trutheless for claims concerning the return of the Voidbringers.

## Details
At some point during his youth, Szeth began hearing a voice in his head, possibly that of a spren. Perhaps as a result of this, he began saying that the Voidbringers were returning to Roshar. The Shin leaders, however, told him that his claims were false and, at the age of 28, named him Truthless. Likely due to his prior high status, he was given Jezrien's Honorblade before being sent awayâ€”something that wasn't done for other Truthless. After being made a slave and given an Oathstone, Szeth was traded to the Thaylen merchant Vstim. From then on, whoever owned his Oathstone owned Szeth, and Szeth was obliged by his honor to do as the owner commanded; with the exception of killing himself or giving up the Honorblade. Just after being exiled from Shinovar, Szeth visited Urithiru for the first time.
