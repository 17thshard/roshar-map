# The Thrill confronts Dalinar
While visiting Vedenar the Thrill confronted Dalinar heavily, causing him to flee to Urithiru.

## Details
Following the failure of Elhokar's team at the Battle of Kholinar, Dalinar took an opportunity to visit troops in Vedenar. While visiting troops who had fought in the Veden civil war, Nergaoul (the Thrill) confronted Dalinar. Already struggling mentally after the apparent loss of Adolin and the rest of Elhokar's team, and facing excommunication by the Vorin church leadership, Dalinar summoned Stormfather as a sort of Shardblade against the spren's will and fled back to Urithiru via Oathgate. There he turned to alcohol to dull his pain, leaving him incapacitated for a week.
