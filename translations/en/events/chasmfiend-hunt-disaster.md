# Chasmfiend hunt
Elhokar was saved by Dalinar when his saddle strap broke during a Chasmfiend hunt gone wrong.

## Details
Dalinar and several highprinces attended Elhokar on a hunting party out onto the Shattered Plains. Upon arriving at their destination, where a small chasmfiend was to be baited, an enormous chasmfiend found its way onto the adjacent plateau, catching the party by surprise. While attacking the beast, Elhokar's saddle strap broke, leaving him vulnerable before the greatshell. Dalinar held the chasmfiend back and they ultimately slew the monster. The broken saddle strap led to an investigation into an aleged assassination attempt.
