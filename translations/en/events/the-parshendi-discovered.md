# The listeners discovered
Gavilar and Dalinar discovered the tribe of listeners, naming them Parshendi.

## Details
In the years after the reunification of Alethkar, Gavilar began to lose his thirst for battle. He had started reading a book called _The Way of Kings_, trying to convince Dalinar and his other Highprinces to be peaceful and to follow the Alethi Codes of War. Like the other Highprinces, Dalinar resisted his brother's ideas, finding them unpalatable and strange--even un-Alethi. To try and change Gavilar's mind, Dalinar convinced him to go an expedition, a hunt for a chasmfiend. He suggested this hoping to remind Gavilar of the good times in their youth, to reawaken his brother's fighting spirit.

In 1166, Dalinar and Gavilar set out on their expedition. In an unmapped forest south of the Shattered Plains, Dalinar met a Parshendi patrol. At first disbelieving what he thought were simple parshmen acting individually in a civilized society, Dalinar quickly accepted that the Parshendi were intelligent and organized, unlike their parshmen cousins. Dalinar brought Gavilar to meet them, and within days the Alethi and Parshendi could communicate well.
