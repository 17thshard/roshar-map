# Taravangian's treachery
Taravangian awaits Odium's signal to betray Dalinar's armies.

## Details
#[Taravangian](characters/taravangian) waits with his armies for #[Odium](characters/odium) to give him the signal to betray #[Dalinar's](characters/dalinar) armies. He is having a dumb day, and as he wishes that he were smart, he realizes that smart Taravangian had failed. He considers that, contrary to what he had thought, the curse wasn't that he wasn't smart on some days, but instead that he could not be both smart and compassionate at the same time. He gets out some of the sheets from the Diagram and wonders why the Diagram cannot see #[Renarin Kholin](characters/renarin).

Odium pulls Taravangian into a vision and tells him that is time to send the orders. As he rambles about his plans, Taravangian realizes that Odium also failed, because he had expected Dalinar to turn. Taravangian manages to maneuver Odium into showing him his plans, and he looks for the blacked out place that reveals that Odium, like him, cannot see the future of Renarin and those that are close to him. Taravangian also realizes that Odium is terrified of Szeth and the sword that he carries and, finally, that Odium can be defeated; he commits to not giving up. Odium ends the vision, and Taravangian sends the message to his troops to betray Dalinar's soldiers. Minutes later, he is arrested. 

With Taravangian's orders sent, Veden armies in #[Jah Keved](locations/jah-keved) turn on their allies and force the nearby Alethi to retreat. Raboniel's forces simultaneously launch their attack on #[Urithiru](locations/urithiru).
