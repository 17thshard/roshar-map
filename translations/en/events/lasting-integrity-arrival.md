# Arrival at Lasting Integrity
The coalition delegation led by Adolin and Shallan arrives at Lasting Integrity.

## Details
On their final day of travel, #[Adolin](characters/adolin) and #[Shallan](characters/shallan) take some time alone to spot a starspren before packing up. Around midday, Felt brings news that the Tukari caravan has split off from trailing them. Calling for a break, Adolin follows the scout onto an outcropping and discusses the situation with him, telling him to keep a watch on them during their break. While on the way back to Gallant, he realizes what the Tukari are chasing Notum.

After riding in close enough to see the Tukari stabbing Notum repeatedly, Adolin confronts the Tukari alone with his greatsword. He drives them away from Notum, using his momentum to intimidate them and thin their numbers. As soon as they back off, however, their leader organizes them so they can surround him. Adolin receives a spear through the abdomen, but he keeps fighting and soon finds that Maya has brought a sword and come to help him. With his back now guarded and Gallant's looming presence helping as well, he is able to kill or scare off the remaining Tukari. A group from the diplomatic mission arrive to find the Tukari gone and the wounded Adolin holding Notum. 

While Godeke binds their wounds, a shocked Notum resists the idea of traveling with Adolin and his group. Adolin orders them to move out immediately, so Shallan decides to check her cube before leaving. Discovering that it has been touched, she realizes that Pattern is the only one who has had access to it. Reaching Lastinng Integrity, Adolin puts up a strong front as three honorspren arrive and immediately dismiss him. He hands over the letters from Dalinar and Jasnah, which the spren tear up without reading. Realizing that he has no options left, Adolin declares that he has come to face the judgement of the honorspren for his ancestors' actions in the Recreance. The spren agree to admit him on those terms and concede that he may bring two others with him, as well as Maya. Adolin directs a few to take word back to #[Dalinar](characters/dalinar) and the rest to camp out nearby. He takes Shallan and Pattern with him and enters the fortress in chains.
