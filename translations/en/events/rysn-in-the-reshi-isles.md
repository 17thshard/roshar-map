# Rysn in the Reshi Isles
Rysn and Vstim traded with the Reshi. Rysn became paralyzed but was gifted a larkin.

## Details
Rysn and Vstim arrived in the Reshi Isles, seeking to trade with the inhabitants of a Tai-na greatshell. Vstim pretended to be deathly ill, and required Rysn to make the trade in his place as a test. Thinking their livelihood must be on the line, Rysn took desparate measures to make the trade, falling from the greatshell in an attempt to prove her bravery. Rysn was left paralyzed from the waist down after the incident. The island gifted her with a living larkin.
