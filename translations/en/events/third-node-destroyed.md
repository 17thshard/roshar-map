# Third node destroyed
The Sibling calls for Kaladin to aid them by destroying the third of their four nodes.

## Details
#[Kaladin](characters/kaladin) wakes from another nightmare to Syl telling him that they’ve received news that the Fused are corrupting another node. They couldn't wake him, so Dabbid has already left. Kaladin catches up to him, and Dabbid hands over his spear and says "Life. Before. Death." Kaladin takes the spear and goes.

#[Navani](characters/navani) tries to stall Raboniel, but the Fused seems to be expecting this. Navani believes it’s a deliberate distraction, and she has a terrible realization that they have been able to hear her communications with the Sibling.

Kaladin uses the glove fabrial and makes his way to the Breakaway, trying to act as though he is using his normal powers. When he arrives, he finds the Pursuer, and they begin to fight. The Heavenly Ones arrive, and Kaladin deals enough damage to the Pursuer to force him to leave and recover. Kaladin goes to Leshwi and motions for a duel, and she accepts. They fight, though Leshwi questions Kaladin as to why he cannot use his powers like normal. She realizes that the fight is a sham, and they argue about whose people should rule. Kaladin leaves abruptly, follows Syl to the well, and dives in. He finds Raboniel and destroys the sapphire before she can finish corrupting it. He starts to make his way out but gets trapped inside with Syl on the outside of the well. He follows the pipes and eventually comes out at a reservoir in the tower. Exiting the reservoir, Kaladin climbs up to the ground floor of the tower, where he encounters guards. To evade them, he jumps out of the tower and into the highstorm.
