# Vision revelation
Navani uncovered evidence that Dalinar's visions may be real when she recognized he was speaking Dawnchant.

## Details
Because Navani was so exacting in her words and thoughts, as well as the only woman in the warcamps he knew he could trust, Dalinar chose her to record his visions. She scribed expertly, picking out details from him, and knowing when to prod him for more. She was business-like and careful and recorded his visions without complaint. 

While she listened to Dalinar's visions she realized that what he was saying had too much order to be gibberish. She discovered a phrase from the Analectics that matched what Dalinar was babbling during his fits. She told him that it was a line from a song, a chant by the Vanrial, written in the Dawnchant by the Heralds. Navani was able to use Dalinar's visions as a guide to help her scholars translate the Dawnchant.
