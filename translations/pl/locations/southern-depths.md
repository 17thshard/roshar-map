# Southern Depths

The **Southern Depths** is the ocean to the south of Roshar. It lies off the coast of #[Tukar](locations/tukar), #[Marat](locations/marat), and #[Thaylenah](locations/thaylenah). It is presumably quite deep. It also likely extends to the south pole of the planet.

It was said if one controls #[Thaylenah](locations/thaylenah) and #[Thaylen City](locations/thaylen-city), one could control the entire Southern Depths. This strategic importance led to Voidbringer forces to Thaylen City near the beginning of the True Desolation. A Thaylen merchant ship tried to scout for Voidbringers in the Southern Depths near Marat and spotted a large number of ships at dock along the coast. The ship relayed the information via spanreed. Then, figures with glowing eyes—the Fused\—rose from a nearby city, attacking the ship, and the ship was never seen from again. Shortly thereafter, the Voidbringer forces launched from Marat to Thaylen City, using the Everstorm to propel them quickly across the Southern Depths, triggering the Battle of Thaylen Fields.
