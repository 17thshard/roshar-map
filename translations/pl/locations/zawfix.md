# Zawfix

**Zawfix** is a city in northeastern #[Azir](locations/azir) on Roshar. It lies at the foot of a mountain range between Azir and #[Yulay](locations/yulay).

Zawfix has shanties built inside of old mines to protect them from highstorms. When #[Lift](characters/lift) encounters shanties in #[Yeddaw](locations/yeddaw), she recalls seeing them in Zawfix.

It is said that when the Sunmaker invaded Azir, he murdered ten percent of the population, and that highstorms piled bones as high as buildings in Zawfix.
