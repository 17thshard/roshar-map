# Longbrow's Straits

**Longbrow's Straits** is a waterway that separates the island of #[Thaylenah](locations/thaylenah) from the #[Frostlands](locations/frostlands) on mainland Roshar. The straits are presumably named for the characteristic long eyebrows of the Thaylen people.

The straits are lined by tall, sleek lighthouses for navigation. Various creatures live in the water, including santhids, khornaks, redwaters, and schools of small fish. The straits become narrow near Klna City, but in some areas they are wide enough that it can be difficult to see land.
