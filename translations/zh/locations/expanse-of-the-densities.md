# Expanse of the Densities

The **Expanse of the Densities** is the Rosharan term for the Selish subastral of the Cognitive Realm. After Splintering Devotion and Dominion, #[Odium](characters/odium) pushed their Investiture into the Cognitive Realm. Due to the contained nature of the space, that Investiture is in an incredibly dangerous and highly pressurized state, similar to plasma. This Investiture fills the region as a deadly storm known as the Dor and is the reason Rosharans call the region the Expanse of the Densities. It strains #[Hoid's](characters/wit) resources to safely travel there, but he has done it on occasion.

It can be accessed from Devotion's Perpendicularity near Elantris, the other Perpendicularity on Sel, or by traveling there from another region of the Cognitive Realm; it is adjacent to to the #[Nexus of Truth](locations/nexus-of-truth) on the Rosharan map of Shadesmar.
