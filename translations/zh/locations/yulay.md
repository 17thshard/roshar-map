# Yulay

**Yulay** is a kingdom in central Roshar.

Yulay's territory primarily consists of a narrow strip of land between the southern shore of the #[Purelake](locations/purelake) and several mountainous areas. It borders #[Tu Bayla](locations/tu-bayla) to the east and #[Babatharnam](locations/babatharnam) to the west. The southern border with #[Azir](locations/azir) is mostly defined by mountains, with the exception of one large pass.

Before the return of the Knights Radiant, some people in Yulay talked about them and hoped that they would return.
