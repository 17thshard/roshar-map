# Kurth

**Kurth**, also known as the **City of Lightning** is a city in northeastern #[Rira](locations/rira). It is situated on an island in the #[Reshi Sea](locations/reshi-sea) just off the east coast of the main Riran landmass.

Kurth was once the capital of the Silver Kingdom of Rishir, and an Oathgate was constructed there to serve the nation and its people. After the fall of Rishir, the city became a part of the nation of Rira. In the course of her research into the Oathgates, #[Jasnah Kholin](characters/jasnah) identified Kurth as the likely site of an Oathgate. While planning how to unite the nations of Roshar in the wake of the Everstorm, members of #[Dalinar Kholin's](characters/dalinar) coalition hoped to open and secure the Kurth Oathgate. During the Last Desolation, the forces of #[Odium](characters/odium) secured the city and held its Oathgate by allying themselves with the Rirans and #[Iriali](locations/iri).

Kurth is well-known as far away as #[Alethkar](locations/alethkar). In his youth, #[Kaladin](characters/kaladin) had heard stories about Kurth, #[Rall Elorim](locations/rall-elorim), and other faraway locales that encouraged his desire to join Torol Sadeas' army in order to see what other lands are like.
