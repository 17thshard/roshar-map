# Valath

**Valath** is a city in #[Jah Keved](locations/jah-keved) next to the #[Horneater Peaks](locations/horneater-peaks).

It is likely in Valam princedom, maybe even the capital.

Valath is the location of the Holy Enclave, and though the Palanaeum has more tomes and scrolls, the Holy Enclave clearly has many tomes themselves.
