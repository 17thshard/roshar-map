# Reshi Sea

The **Reshi Sea** is a body of water in northern Roshar. It contains the #[Reshi Isles](locations/reshi-isles) and is separated from the #[Purelake](locations/purelake) by #[Marabethia](locations/marabethia). It borders #[Iri](locations/iri), #[Rira](locations/rira), #[Babatharnam](locations/babatharnam), #[Tu Bayla](locations/tu-bayla), #[Jah Keved](locations/jah-keved), and #[Herdaz](locations/herdaz).

The Reshi Sea is deeper than the purelake, but is shallow enough that Tai-na legs are able to reach the bottom of making it shallow enough to be warm nearly all the time.

Ashir and Geranid live on a small island in the Reshi Sea.
