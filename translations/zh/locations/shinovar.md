# Shinovar
> The world is changing outside, but the Shin seem determined to remain the same.

**Shinovar** is a nation on the western mainland of Roshar. Due to the #[mountains](locations/misted-mountains) separating it from the rest of the continent, Shinovar is distinct both ecologically and culturally from the rest of Roshar. Shinovar natives are known as the **Shin**.
