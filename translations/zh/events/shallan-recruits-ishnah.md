# Shallan recruits Ishnah
Shallan recruited Ishnah after the woman made several attempts to prove her value.

## Details
Ishnah began following Veil after having revealed herself to be a Ghostblood in All's Alley, hoping to become a member herself. Shallan rejected the woman after their first encounter. Later, while discussing the usefulness of the soldiers, Veil noticed a washwoman observing them nearby. Recognizing the woman as Ishnah, Veil questioned her. She soon discovered that Ishnah was once a spy and hoped to join the Ghostbloods by proving herself. Seeing this as an opportunity to learn more about being a spy, Veil gave Ishnah the option of teaching her men how to be spies in exchange for promising to see if she would be worthy to join the Ghostbloods.
