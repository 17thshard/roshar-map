# Taravangian arrives in Urithiru
Taravangian and his followers, including the Dustbringer Malata, arrive in Urithiru.

## Details
After his failure to assassinate Dalinar, Taravangian decided on an alternate strategy. When Dalinar called for the unification of Roshar against the Voidbringer threat, following the advent of the Everstorm, Taravangian was the first and only king to initially agree. Shortly thereafter, with the help of his Radiant, Malata, Taravangian moved to Urithiru to be closer to Dalinar.
