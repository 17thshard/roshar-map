# The Fourth Bridge arrives
The 'Fourth Bridge' arrives at Narak and the refugees move in to Urithiru. Kaladin decides to work with his father as a surgeon.

## Details
The 'Fourth Bridge' arrives at the #[Shattered Plains](locations/shattered-plains) after four weeks of travel, and #[Kaladin](characters/kaladin) operates the Oathgate to travel there and greet the ship. An hour later, he leads his parents up to the sixth floor of #[Urithiru](locations/urithiru) to show them the neighborhood that has been arranged for the former #[Hearthstone](locations/hearthstone) residents. Syl, Hesina, and Lirin banter in the hallways before they reach the rooms. Kaladin shows them around the area, assuming that Lirin disapproves of the arrangements because of his silence. Syl excitedly leads the group to the rooms they have prepared for Kaladin's family and gives them a tour of a sitting room with a full bookshelf, Oroden's room, and a fully stocked surgery. Lirin finally admits that he thinks his kind of medical care is obsolete now, but Kaladin is able to explain to him that it isn't. At Syl's prompting, Kaladin tells his overjoyed parents that he has retired from battle and wants to be a surgeon with his father.
