# Ashyn 大出逃
为了逃过他们家乡的毁灭，Ashyn的人类在深国定居。

## Details
> They came from another world, using powers that we have been forbidden to touch. Dangerous powers, of spren and Surges. They destroyed their lands and have come to us begging. We took them in, as commanded by the gods. What else could we do? They were a people forlorn, without a home. Our pity destroyed us.
> —From the Eila Stele

> 他们来自另一个世界，使用着禁忌的力量。危险的，灵体与飓能的力量。他们毁灭了他们的土地而向我们乞求，我们按照神意接纳了他们。我们又能做什么呢？他们已经绝望，无家可归。我们的怜悯毁了我们。
> —伊埃拉碑碣
