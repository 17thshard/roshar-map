# 世界现状
Dalinar and the coalition consider the state of the world following the Battle of Thaylen Field.

泰勒拿之战过后的世界现状。

## Details
Shallan, Dalinar, and many of Dalinar's generals as well as a few members of the coalition gather in a room in Urithiru. Shallan uses her Lightweaving to make a map of Roshar at Dalinar's request, changing the colors of various countries to depict which ones are members of the coalition, members of Azir's coalition, lands controlled by Odium, and lands that hadn't committed to either side, such as Shinovar and Tukar. The generals argue over what course of action to pursue, and Shallan raises the question of why the humans don't just retreat to Shinovar, the land they were given, to which Dalinar answers that Odium will overrun them even if they give the Parshendi what they deserve. 

Dalinar and Adolin argue over who should become the next King of Alethkar, with Dalinar not wanting Gavinor, as he's too young. Not wanting to accept the responsibility himself, Adolin reveals his murder of Torol Sadeas to Dalinar and his breaking of the Codes of War. Ultimate, Jasnah is chosen to become queen of Alethkar.

> 达力拿穿过幻象，抬手按住伊里、里拉和巴巴萨那姆所在的区域。“把这块地区变成亮金色。”【……】根据对芦传来的报告，淳湖周围的小国大都被伊里占领了。为了得到世代觊觎的地盘，他们在融族的陪同下行动，总共到手了三座誓约之门。在达力拿的要求下，沙兰把地图上那些国家涂成了亮金色。她为亚泽尔和它的保护国画上蓝色和栗色的图案，这是亚泽尔的文官为国家间的联盟所挑选的标志。【……】在达力拿的要求下，她继续为地形着色。玛拉特和周边国家都变成了金色，阿勒斯卡也不幸如此，而深国和图卡这样的国家还没有表态，她就变成了绿色，结果呈现出一片压抑的大陆图景，蒙上多国联盟颜色的区域少之又少。
