# Shallan leaves the Ghostbloods
Shallan calls Mraize and declares that she will no longer be working for the Ghostbloods.

## Details
#[Adolin](characters/adolin) and #[Shallan](characters/shallan), in a room with their three spren, think that Testament looks better since Adolin's talk with her. They use Shallan's Seon, Ala, to contact Mraize, and Shallan tells him that, instead of killing Kelek, Veil has reintegrated herself with Shallan. Mraize tries to entice her back to the #[Ghostbloods](misc/ghostbloods) with both promises of secrets and threats against her family, but Shallan is adamant and tells him that she will get to Ba-Ado-Mishram before the Ghostbloods can. Before ending the call, she tells Mraize the Ghostbloods had better vacate #[Urithiru](locations/urithiru) before she returns and gives him messages from herself and from #[Wit](characters/wit) to deliver to Thaidakar when his avatar next visits.
