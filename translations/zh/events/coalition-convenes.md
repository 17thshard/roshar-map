## Details
The coalition of monarchs gathers in #[Urithiru](locations/urithiru) to plan their next steps in the war. #[Navani](characters/navani) immediately runs into #[Taravangian](characters/taravangian) who, sincerely and terrifyingly, to her mind, explains that he has always been looking out for the future of Roshar before Noura begins the meeting by having #[Dalinar](characters/dalinar) outline his proposed attack on #[Emul](locations/emul). Yanagawn shortly adds his support, followed by Taravangian; the latter's agreement causes the Alethi to second guess their idea. When Queen Fen approves the mission as well, she brings up the dearth of honorspren. Sigzil proposes the idea of sending an envoy to their capital. After discussing their options, #[Shallan](characters/shallan) volunteers to lead the mission along with #[Adolin](characters/adolin); they decide to take Godeke, a Truthwatcher, and a Stoneward as well. After dinner with the Thaylen leaders, Navani relaxes with Dalinar by their heating fabrial. They sift through Taravangian's motivations together before Dalinar asks Navani to stay behind to run the tower while he is in Emul.
