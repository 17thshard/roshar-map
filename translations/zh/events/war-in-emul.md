# War in Emul continues
The coalition's military campaign continues, with Jasnah marching alongside the soldiers into battle.

## Details
#[Jasnah](characters/jasnah) is going into war, thinking of how inadequate the descriptions and depictions of war have been in her studies. She is wearing her Shardplate, dulled so as to not reveal who she is. She at first is determined to confront the enemy without using her powers so that she can fully understand the feeling of war. She fights with a Fused capable of growing carapace vines over her and decides to use her powers after all, Soulcasting the air to oil and slamming steel and flint together to light everyone near her on fire. She loses herself in the battle, and eventually an Edgedancer medic convinces her to rest. #[Wit](characters/wit) brings her fruit, and they discuss her experience and what she is trying to prove to herself and others. They discuss the future of battle, and she returns to war.

When the battle is over, Jasnah arrives at her tent and speaks with the Mink, who assures her she made the right decision and that they won the day. He also tells her that something has disturbed Wit, whom she finds in her tent writing. Wit tells her that one of the Sleepless was disguised in his things, and that their secrets have been compromised. He decides to divulge what he knows of Thaidakar and the #[Ghostbloods](misc/ghostbloods).
