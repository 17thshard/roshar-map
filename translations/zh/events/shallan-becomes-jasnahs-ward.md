# Shallan becomes Jasnah's ward
Shallan arrived in Kharbranth and became Jasnah's ward, planning to steal the princess's Soulcaster.

## Details
After months of chasing Jasnah Kholin from port to port, Shallan finally caught up with her in Karbranth. Her first petition was rejected outright, due to Shallan's lacking education. She approached Jasnah a second time that day in the Pallanaeum, after which Jasnah promised to give her another opportunity at a later date. With no time to spare due to her family's desparate financial situation, Shallan purchased books in the city and set about studying that night. Jasnah approached Shallan and accepted her as a ward.
