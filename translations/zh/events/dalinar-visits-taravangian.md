# Dalinar visits Taravangian
Dalinar visits Taravangian and they discuss the ethics of what Taravangian has done.

## Details
#[Dalinar](characters/dalinar) experiments with his Bondsmith powers and learns how to see someone's Connections to others. He leaves to talk to #[Taravangian](characters/taravangian). Dalinar asks why Taravangian betrayed them, and Taravangian explains that he knows that they are going to lose and this is the only way he can save at least #[Kharbranth](locations/kharbranth). He says that #[Cultivation](characters/cultivation) granted him the capacity to stop what was coming, and on his one transcendently brilliant day this was the path he saw. Dalinar tells him that he doesn't think that Taravangian could have seen the future perfectly and that he, Dalinar, has to believe that it is possible to defeat Odium. Taravangian wishes he were dealing with the Dalinar from before because he believes that that Dalinar would see the necessity of joining Odium. Taravangian believes that monarchs cannot allow themselves to be bound by oaths because they have to be able to engage in the kind of ignoble behavior that he has had to be willing for. He says that he could die happy if Dalinar saves mankind and he knows he was wrong, but Dalinar believes that Taravangian's actions prove that he had just wanted the power. After Dalinar leaves, #[Szeth's](characters/szeth) proffered opinion reinforces his feeling that they cannot trust Taravangian.
