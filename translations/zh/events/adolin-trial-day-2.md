The second day of Adolin's trial by witness in Lasting Integrity.

## Details
#[Adolin](characters/adolin) arrives for the second day of his trial and takes the stand. As he speaks he is continually interrupted by the honorspren audience, who do everything they can to disrupt him with their own accusations. The trial devolves into a full fledged argument, and Adolin finally gives up, inviting the honorspren to continue their attack as it is clear that they did not have honorable intentions in this trial. The audience is initially cowed, but their anger reignites when they learn that Adolin knew about the recently deadeye Cryptic he had found in the market.

#[Shallan](characters/shallan) joins Adolin after the trial, and Adolin is certain that he will be locked away and put on display. Shallan says that she'll break him out with the Stormlight she stole, but Adolin says that leaving him would be the honorable thing to do, and may even convince some of the honorspren to bond more Radiants. Shallan reflects on whether to impersonate Kelek to save Adolin, and just as she decides to do it, Veil changes her mind to keep her from doing it. Formless surfaces and takes over, and tells Adolin that he may be surprised by what the High Judge does.
