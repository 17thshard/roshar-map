# War in Emul concludes
The final battle of the Emuli campaign concludes as Dalinar and Jasnah make plans for their next steps in the war against Odium.

## Details
#[Dalinar](characters/dalinar) walks through the battlefield on the #[Emuli](locations/emul) front with #[Szeth](characters/szeth) and several allied generals. He analyzes the battle, remembering the #[Rift](locations/rathalas) and thinking about #[Taravangian's](characters/taravangian) advice to stop fighting #[Odium](characters/odium). After congratulating other groups of victors, the Mink comes to speak with him. They discuss the enemy's tactics before Dalinar again promises to free #[Herdaz](locations/herdaz) first after they free #[Alethkar](locations/alethkar).

Meanwhile, #[Jasnah](characters/jasnah) relaxes in her tent with #[Wit](characters/wit) just after receiving word of the coalition's victory in Emul. She sorts through her notes from interviews with the Heralds, trying to find something to help with the situation at #[Urithiru](locations/urithiru), and admits her worry to Wit that Odium can see the future while they can't. Wit replies that they need to make sure Odium can't win even if he is sure not to lose. He presents to her his draft of a contract between Dalinar and Odium, explaining that one of Rayse's weaknesses is that he wants not only to win but to win in a way that shows off his intelligence. Wit states that the contest of champions will be no simple duel, but a matter of the heart of each champion; when asked if she trusts the hearts of those she fights alongside, Jasnah has no answer. She asks Wit who he really is, and he tells her that he is a man who is not bound.
