# Kaladin helps Noril
Kaladin and Teft locate Noril, a missing refugee suffering from a mental illness, and make plans to help him and others recover.

## Details
Teft joins #[Kaladin](characters/kaladin) in a search for Noril, a missing refugee from #[Hearthstone](locations/hearthstone). The ardent at the first devotary they go to tells them that Noril had tried to kill himself, so they had sent him to the Devotary of Mercy. Following her directions, Kaladin and Teft find the devotary on the fourth floor. The ardent there refuses to divulge patient information until Teft summons Phendorana and proves that they are of sufficient rank to authorize the request. After looking up the room number, the ardent leads them to Noril. On the way, Kaladin and Teft are both disillusioned by seeing the way that all the patients are locked up in the dark. They convince Noril to come out to a balcony to talk, and when Kaladin and Teft prove that they understand how he feels, Noril begins to open up to them. Kuno, shocked to see Noril speaking, discusses with Kaladin the standard of care for those with mental illness. He admits that they need to do better but sees no way to change the established system; Kaladin asks that Noril be released into his care and warns Kuno that he will be back for the others.
