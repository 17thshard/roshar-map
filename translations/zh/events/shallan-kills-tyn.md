# Shallan kills Tyn
Shallan used her Shardblade to kill Tyn, after her identity is discovered.

## Details
With a highstorm approaching at night and the sun soon setting, Tyn and Shallan decided to spend one last night in camp after reaching the Shattered Plains. Tyn invited Shallan to attend her later during a meeting with an informant via spanreed so that they could inquire for more information. As they met with the informant, Shallan learned that her own family's own highprince, Valam, was preparing to assault Vedenar itself. The informant continued with information on the deserters Shallan had recruited. To Shallan's dismay, Tyn insisted that they should turn the men over in exchange for reward. Her resistance prompted a firm lecture from Tyn, which left Shallan distracted by how to handle the situation. A new message soon came with news regarding the presumed death of Jasnah Kholin. As Shallan began to realize that Tyn was involved with the Ghostbloods, additional information came through about Jasnah's ward--Shallan herself. Tyn quickly realized the truth and attacked Shallan. Pattern was able to distract the woman for a short time by using Jasnah's voice, but when she finally approached Shallan with sword drawn, Shallan swiftly summoned Pattern as a Shardblade and pierced her through the chest. A moment latter Shallan's men poured into the room, having been warned by Pattern, to find Shallan with her Shardblade and Tyn dead on the ground. Shallan swore them to silence and set them about searching through Tyn's things. Only then did Shallan notice that the informant had continued writing with a request from the Ghostbloods for a meeting in the warcamps. Seeing an opportunity to discover how much the Ghostbloods knew, Shallan responded affirmatively.
