# Roshone arrives in Hearthstone
Exiled from Kholinar by Dalinar, Roshone arrived as citylord of Hearthstone.

## Details
In Kholinar, Roshone used his connections to have a pair of elderly darkeyes, Moash's grandparents, arrested on false charges. The pair died in prison, and when Dalinar found out he had the man exiled. Roshone was placed as the citylord of Hearthstone, where Dalinar assumed he could cause no harm. Upon his arrival, Roshone showed no respect for the inhabitants, and appeared particularly distasteful of Lirin, whom he blamed for the death of the previous citylord.
