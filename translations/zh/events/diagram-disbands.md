# The Diagram disbands
Taravangian meets with the inner circle of the Diagram and the group disbands.

## Details
#[Taravangian](characters/taravangian) gathers his friends to tell them farewell in his chambers at #[Urithiru](locations/urithiru). Later that day, he plans to leave for #[Emul](locations/emul) with #[Dalinar](characters/dalinar) and #[Jasnah](characters/jasnah), while the rest of the #[Diagram](misc/diagram) would go back to #[Kharbranth](locations/kharbranth). In Emul, Taravangian intends to have his armies betray the coalition, fulfiling his part of the agreement with 3[Odium](odium). #[Jah Keved](locations/jah-keved) too will turn against the coalition at that time. He announces to his group that the Diagram has served its purpose and now has to be disbanded. Kharbranth is to distance itself from Taravangian's actions, so that the city may be able to stay out of the war. After his friends leave the room, Taravangian reassures himself that saving a single city was really all he could’ve done, and he throws his copy of the Diagram into the fire.
