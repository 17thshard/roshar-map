## Details
The False Desolation, considered pseudohistorical by the Vorin church, was a conflict between singers and humans sometime during the millenia after the Last Desolation. It is likely the conflict in which the Knights Radiant were fighting at the time of the Recreance, according to Jasnah Kholin. It resulted in the enslavement of singers as parshmen.
