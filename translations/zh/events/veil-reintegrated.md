# Veil reintegrates with Shallan
Before following through with 穆里兹's orders, Shallan accepts her memories of Testament and rejects Formless.

## Details
#[Shallan](characters/shallan), as Formless, rises early the day of #[Adolin's](characters/adolin) final judgement. Adolin speaks to her about the mistake often made when judging strength and weakness before she convinces him to stay in bed. Formless plans her entry into Kelek's house but is interrupted by both Veil speaking up from deep within her and by Pattern. She Lightweaves an illusion of Lusintia around herself, but then Pattern makes a final attempt to speak with her and she firmly tells him to stay in the house.

Pattern catches up with Formless on the way to Kelek's house, and he delivers a message from Wit: Shallan deserves to be trusted and loved. Formless turns away from him again and goes on alone. Radiant interrupts her by confessing that she killed Ialai Sadeas just as Formless gets to the house, but she musters her determination to go through with her plan and enters anyway. Just after drawing 穆里兹's knife, Formless feels Stormlight leaving her and looks around to see Veil. Veil accuses her of really just being Shallan, and she admits the truth but still feels like she wants to take this step and join the Ghostbloods. Veil keeps telling Shallan that she really is strong while Shallan admits to killing her parents. Then Shallan accepts Veil's memories and sees that the Cryptic she had bonded as a child was not Pattern at all, but Testament.

As Radiant whispers encouragement to her, Shallan makes one last struggle with herself, reaching for the door to Kelek's room before finally turning away and creating a Stormlight reproduction of the scene when she killed Testament. At the conclusion of the scene, Veil integrates herself into Shallan and Kelek walks into the room. Shallan admits that she had been sent by the Ghostbloods to kill him and asks him to go easy on Adolin in the trial. As they converse, a group of honorspren burst into the house and accuse them of collusion. Despite their denials, Sekeir orders Kelek sequestered.
