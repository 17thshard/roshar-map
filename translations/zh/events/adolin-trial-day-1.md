# Adolin's trial - Day 1
The first day of Adolin's trial by witness in Lasting Integrity.

## Details
#[Adolin](characters/adolin) arrives at his trial, where the judge and the spren audience await. They discuss the terms of the trial, and Sekeir calls his witnesses. The first, Amuna, brings two of her deadeye charges and testifies to the travesty that killed them. The second witness is Blended. She not only says that humans should not be trusted, but that they might even consider bonding with the Fused as the rightful heirs of the land. However, she would rather no bonds happen in order to ensure that no spren will be killed. The third witness is Notum. He appears in uniform, and Adolin realizes that Notum has been told that if he will testify against Adolin, they will end his exile. Notum begins to speak, looking at the paper he brought, but then stops and says, “Honor is not dead so long as he lives in the hearts of men.” The crowd erupts, and Notum continues to bellow this phrase as he is dragged from the room. Adolin goes to speak to Kelek and asks what happened. Kelek tells him that the stakes of this trial are much more than he thought because some spren are considering joining the highspren and the Fused, and Adolin could tip the scales in the opposite direction.

After the trial, #[Shallan](characters/shallan) climbs a tree and falls to the ground, faking a severe injury. Pattern plays along, and they convince the honorspren to take her to where their Stormlight is kept. They do so, and she steals a sphere, replacing it with a dun one and pretending that she had drained in to heal herself. The honorspren are appalled at how she could consume so much Stormlight, and they shuffle her from the room.
