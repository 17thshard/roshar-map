# Disadvantaged duel
With the help of Kaladin and Renarin, Adolin defeated four Shardbearers in a duel

## Details
On his mission to win Shards for House Kholin, Adolin accepted a dueling challenge from Relis Ruthar. Based on the careless wording of his acceptance, Adolin unwittingly accepted a duel against multiple Shardbearers. Relis was accompanied by Elit, Abrobadarm, and Jakamav on the day of the duel. Shortly after the duel began, Renarin donned his Shards and charged into the arena to help his brother, but he was unable to provide much assistance due to his inability to handle his screaming Shardblade. Kaladin also jumped into the ring and, with subtle use of his Surgebinding powers, was able to turn the tides. Adolin arose victorious, though his ultimate plan to demand a duel with Sadeas was interrupted by Kaladin's own demand for vengeance against Amaram.
