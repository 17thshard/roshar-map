# Hearthstone Evacuated
The town of Hearthstone was evacuated by the *Fourth Bridge* on its maiden voyage.

## Details
While the *Fourth Bridge* was being tested on its maiden voyage over the #[Steamwater Ocean](locations/steamwaterocean), #[Kaladin](characters/kaladin) proposed a more rigorous test opportunity: rescuing the inhabitants of #[Hearthstone](locations/hearthstone) along with the infamous #[Herdazian](locations/herdaz) general, the Mink. On the morning of the ship's arrival, Kaladin was spotted by the enemy while scouting ahead. As the residents of Hearthstone began boarding, the Windrunners acompanying the ship rose to defend against an arriving group of Fused. After sparring with Leshwi, Kaladin was drawn away into a trap set by the Pursuer. Kaladin defeated the Pursuer and his men, but failed to save Roshone from #[Moash](characters/moash). #[Renarin](characters/renarin) was able to drive Moash away and rescue Kaladin from his former friend. The Fused were held off, and the *Fourth Bridge* began its return journey to #[Narak](locations/narak).
