# Gavilar's assassination
Gavilar Kholin was assassinated by Szeth on behalf of the listeners. Highprinces swore the Vengeance Pact, and the War of Reckoning began.

## Details
After the discovering of the listeners near the Shattered Plains, Gavilar took a sudden interest in their people and eventually invited them to Kholinar to sign a treaty. Finding Eshonai wandering the halls of the palace, Gavilar spoke with her alone, revealing a dark, myserious sphere and speaking of plans to bring on the return of the listener gods. Eshonai took this news back to her leaders, who purchased Szeth and arranged the assassination of Gavilar that very night. Szeth succesfully assassinated Gavilar and fled the city. The listener leaders gave themselves up while the rest of their people fled to the Shattered Plains. In the following days, the Alethi highprinces swore the Vengeance Pact and sent armies to the Shattered Plains to fight the War of Reckoning.
