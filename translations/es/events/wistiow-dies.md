# Wistiow muere
Wistiow, citylord of Hearthstone, died unexpectedly.

## Details
Around early 1166, an army passed through Hearthstone and asked Citylord Wistiow's permission to recruit a few of the older boys in town. A few weeks later, Wistiow became ill and Lirin began to treat him in his mansion. Within a week, Wistiow's already frail health had diminished substantially and he lost lucidity as he entered his final days. Knowing the marriage between Kaladin and Laral was now in jeopardy, Lirin prepared the appropriate documents, as well as a simple will written in glyphs that would grant Kaladin a supply of diamond broams to fund his education in Kharbranth. He had Wistiow's scribes read the message to the man, before Wistiow sent them away. Wistiow was not coherent enough to stamp the documents, so Lirin did it himself. Wistiow passed away shortly thereafter.
