# Lift saves the Stump
Lift visited Yeddaw and saved the Stump from Nale as the Everstorm arrived.

## Details
After the encounter with Nale in Azimir, Lift quietly followed the Herald to Yeddaw, where he continued hunting Radiants. Nale tasked his Skybreaker squires with hunting a Radiant in the city. When they failed Nale approached the Radiant herself, called the Stump by Lift. Lift was able to protect the Stump however, convincing Nale that the Last Desolation had begun and his mission to hunt Radiants was in vain.
