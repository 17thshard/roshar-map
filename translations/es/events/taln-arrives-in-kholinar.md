# Taln arrives in Kholinar
Recently returned to Roshar, Taln arrived in Kholinar where he was awaited by Wit.

## Details
Around four and a half millennia later, not long after the Battle of the Tower, Talenel returned to Roshar from Damnation. It is uncertain how he returned or where precisely he arrived, but he was covered in condensation, and had twigs and leaves stuck in his beard. Taln quickly rushed to Kholinar, cutting through the city gate with his Honorblade to give warning to the Alethi that the True Desolation was upon them. Hoid knew when and where Taln would arrive, and was waiting in Kholinar for him. After his proclamation, Taln promptly collapsed.
