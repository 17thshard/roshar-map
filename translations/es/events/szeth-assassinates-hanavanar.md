# Szeth assassinates Hanavanar
Szeth assassinated King Hanavanar of Jah Keved, and the Veden civil war begins.

## Details
Szeth's new masters gave him a list of high-ranking targets, all of whom were to be eliminated with the same skill displayed over five years prior in Kholinar. Szeth set out to do just that, carving a bloody path across the continent. His second-to-last kill was King Hanavanar of Jah Keved, whom he killed along with his two Shardbearer guards. Szeth arrived during a banquet to find that his coming was expected and the banquet had been intended as a trap. After Szeth slaughtered the guards and several people trying to flee, two Shardbearers came out from hiding and another squad wearing half-shards enter the room to attack. Szeth dropped his sword and used his Windrunner abilities to fling the attackers about the room. He infused a stone multiple times and lashes it toward one of the Shardbearers, crushing him to death. He killed the rest of the honor guard easily and slammed himself down on the king, pinning him to the floor, before assassinating him with his Blade.
