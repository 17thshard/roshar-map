# Dawn's Shadow

**Dawn's Shadow** is a location, presumably a settlement, on the coast of far eastern Roshar.

It is located east of the #[Unclaimed Hills](locations/unclaimed-hills), on a sea connected to the #[Ocean of Origins](locations/ocean-of-origins). It is situated in the former Silver Kingdom of Natanatan. The nearest population center is the city-state of #[New Natanan](locations/new-natanan).

Although eastern Roshar has been described as a "crumbling" empty wasteland, Dawn's Shadow is known to some mapmakers in #[Alethkar](locations/alethkar).
