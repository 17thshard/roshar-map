# Odium

> It was hatred. A deep, pulsing hatred with a pressure to turn all things molten. It was the heat of a thousand suns, it was the bliss of every kiss, it was the lives of all men wrapped up in one, defined by everything they felt.

**Odium** is a Shard of Adonalsium held by Rayse. Unlike most other Shards, which typically pick a single world and settle there, Odium has been traveling freely throughout the cosmere for a long time, deliberately refusing to Invest himself anywhere. He is responsible for the deaths of at least four Shards—Devotion, Dominion, Ambition and #[Honor](characters/honor). In the present, he's confined to the planet Braize, but his influence can be felt on the entire Rosharan system. Odium’s Investiture is typically associated with “burning” gold or violet-black colors, though it is also often red, the color that signifies corrupted Investiture.
